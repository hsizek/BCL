We work together to create, maintain and expand affordable housing in Bloomington, Indiana without a profit motive by: Creating institutional structures that allow community-based ownership and administration of large assets in order to benefit from economy of scale and prevent profiteering Establishing governance structures and shared values that help us end exploitation of people in need of housing Building administrative and decision-making structures that encourage collective democratic decision-making Recognizing the ways in which our members and affiliates are already part of the communities around us as workers, students, friends and families while integrating ourselves and our work into local communities and institutions Recruiting members who are capable of providing help and support to other members Addressing member's material and emotional needs inter-personally and institutionally Responding to members experiencing distress with compassion and care for both the member and the community Rejecting the imbalanced power dynamics created by charity Expecting members to contribute to our common cause to the extent they are able Asking members to learn and grow in their work toward the fulfillment of all aspects of this mission statement and supporting one another\u2019s growth to this end As part of the BLC mission and commitment to affordable housing, 75% our members meet national, state, and local low-income standards.
