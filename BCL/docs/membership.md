- The member can then reach out to you to chat, whether through text or call, often an interview is scheduled
- You come to the interview, whether in person or over zoom if you aren't in town
- After the interview, the house members vote on offering you a room.

This process takes at minimum 2-3 weeks. If membershiping for the full lease year the process can take a little longer, depending on the house's interview and voting schedule.

Each house has slightly different interview processes, which reflect the house's norms and expectations. Feel free to ask who you schedule the interview with any questions you might have.
