# Houses
BCL has 5 houses across Bloomington. Rooms range from around $500 to $900 depending on house and the quality of the room. We have two suites, in Trellis, which have an additional cost. 

The monthly cost covers includes the cost of the room, utilities, food, and organization maintenance. In addition to the monthly cost, members are expected to do around 5 hours of chores, often two hours of an assigned chore and then three hours of cooking and cleaning, a week. Each house has a weekly meeting on Sunday nights after dinner. These meetings are essential to operation of the houses, as we can keep updated on the house day-to-day items and make sure that issues are addressed promptly.  

## Goodlawn
