# ![logo](./images/BCL_logo.svg){: style="height:80px;width:80px"} Bloomington Cooperative Living 

We are Bloomington's primary cooperative living organization. 

In our houses, we share the responsibilities of managing a household as well as the community it creates. Members can expect to:

* Cook for the house on a weekly basis, and enjoy the food cooked by others on a daily basis
* Take up a regular household chore, whether it is getting groceries or cleaning common areas
* Contribute positively to the house's culture and function
* Interact with other members of BCL and the broader community

We are currently accepting applications for partial leases (now-ish to August). Partial leases usually have the ability to be extended. The current houses looking for partial leases are:

* Mercury
* Middle Earth
* Trellis
* Which House

Applications for full year leases, August 1 - July 30, are open, starting in mid-March for **all houses**. 

For details on the application process and what life is like at BCL, see [Live Here](membership).

For details on the individual houses, look at [our houses page](Houses).

## Board at BCL
Most houses offer half or full board. If you board at one of the houses, you can come by for food, often dinner, multiple times a week. Sometimes boarders will help out the houses in other ways, like finding a home for their suplus zuchinni in August. If you are interested in boarding, contact us through email, <>, or talk with someone in the organization about it!

## Being involved in other ways
Community members are more than welcome to get involved with BCL! 

A good way to start is to board with a house to get to know people. If you want to share a particular skill, such as gardening, grant writing, contracting, etc., feel free to contact us through email, <>, or talk with a member about how you would like to get involved in BCL.
