# Bloomington Cooperative Living
We are Bloomingtons primary cooperative living organization. 

In our houses, we share the responsibilities of managing a household as well as the community it creates. Members can expect to:

* Cook for the house on a weekly basis, and enjoy the food cooked by others on a daily basis
* Take up a regular household chore, whether it is getting groceries or cleaning common areas
* Contribute positively to the house's culture and function
* Interact with other members of BCL and the broader community
